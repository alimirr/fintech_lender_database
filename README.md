# fintech_lender_database

Academic project showcasing our SQL knowledge. Employed the bottoms-up approach. Came up with final output reports first and then reverse engineered the database backwards. The approach unravels the labyrinth of requirements and makes the reverse engineering straightforward compared to making a whimsical diagram and assessing what we can do with it.

The database setup and queries were accomplished using the MySQL Workbench interface.

Details are inside the Final Report PDF along with the queries and setup code.
